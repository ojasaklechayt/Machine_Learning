## Data Description

The dataset contains the following attributes:

- **User_ID**: Unique identifier for each user.
- **Product_ID**: Unique identifier for each product.
- **Gender**: User's gender (Male/Female).
- **Age**: User's age group (e.g., `0-17`, `18-25`, etc.).
- **Occupation**: User's occupation category.
- **City_Category**: Type of city (e.g., `A`, `B`, `C`).
- **Stay_In_Current_City_Years**: Number of years the user has stayed in their current city.
- **Marital_Status**: User's marital status (`0` = Single, `1` = Married).
- **Product_Category_1**: Primary category of the product.
- **Product_Category_2**: Secondary product category.
- **Product_Category_3**: Tertiary product category.
- **Purchase**: Amount spent by the user.

## Analysis Steps

The project follows these steps:

1. **Data Loading**:
   - Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handle missing values.
   - Correct data types where necessary.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualize demographics (gender, age, marital status).
   - Analyze product popularity.
   - Study city-wise purchasing patterns.

4. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Create new features to improve predictive modeling.

5. **Model Building**:
   - Use machine learning algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees) to predict future sales.

6. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or RÂ².

## Results

Key findings include:

- **Demographics**: Identified gender and age groups that dominate purchases.
- **Popular Products**: Uncovered which product categories are most sold.
- **City Insights**: Highlighted purchasing trends across different city types.
- **Predictions**: Provided insights into potential future sales using machine learning models.
